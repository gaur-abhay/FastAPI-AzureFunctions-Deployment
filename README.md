This repository demonstrates how to deploy a FastAPI application to **Azure Functions** using the v2 model with a `function_app.py` file. The goal of this project is to showcase the deployment process of a basic FastAPI app using Azureâ€™s serverless computing capabilities.

## ðŸŒŸAbout

This is a learning project aimed at showcasing the deployment process of a FastAPI application to Azure Functions. I am working on FastAPI-related tasks at Mila AI, and this project helps me apply and demonstrate my knowledge of deploying cloud applications, focusing on the serverless approach using Azure.

## ðŸ› Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- **Azure CLI**: [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- **Azure Functions Core Tools**: For running functions locally. [Install here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local).
- **FastAPI & Uvicorn**: Install using:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn
    ```

Once the FastAPI application code is set up with a basic structure, you'll need to ensure that it can handle HTTP requests when deployed as an Azure Function. The setup includes a simple FastAPI app with one or two routes to demonstrate the deployment.

We will use the v2 model of Azure Functions, which structures the project using a `function_app.py` file, eliminating the need for a `function.json` file.

---

## Creating an Azure Function

Next, weâ€™ll initialize the Azure Function and set up the HTTP trigger to route requests to our FastAPI app.

1. Initialize a new Azure Function in your project directory:
    ```bash
    func init --worker-runtime python
    ```

3. Create an HTTP-triggered function:
    ```bash
    func new --name HttpTrigger --template "HTTP trigger" --authlevel "anonymous"
    ```

4. Modify `function_app.py` to route requests to FastAPI app (as given in codebase).

## ðŸš€Deploying FastAPI to Azure Functions

Deploying the FastAPI app to Azure Functions involves the following steps:

1. **Login to Azure** via CLI:
    ```bash
    az login
    ```

2. **Deploy the App**:

   - First, create a ZIP file of your function app:
     ```bash
     zip -r function.zip .
     ```

   - Then, deploy the ZIP file to your Azure Function App:
     ```bash
     az functionapp deployment source config-zip --name <YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME> --resource-group <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --src function.zip
     ```

## Testing the Deployment

Once deployed, you can test your FastAPI app by accessing the provided function URL.

1. **Get the URL**:
   The Azure CLI will output the URL for function app after deployment. It will look something like:
   ```
   https://<YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/HttpTrigger
   ```

2. **Test the API**:
   Use `curl` or Postman to send a request to your FastAPI endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl https://<YOUR_FUNCTION_APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/HttpTrigger
   ```

   You should see a JSON response similar to:
   ```json
   {
       "message": "Hello from FastAPI deployed on Azure Functions!"
   }
   ```

## ðŸ§ What I Learned

While working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **Deploying FastAPI apps** to **Azure Functions** using the serverless model.
- Understanding how **WSGI middleware** works to integrate FastAPI with Azure Functions.
- Using **Azure CLI** for managing resources, creating Function Apps, and deploying applications.
- Configuring FastAPI to work in a **serverless environment** with automatic scaling based on demand.

## ðŸŽ¯Conclusion

This project serves as a demonstration of deploying a simple FastAPI application to Azure Functions using the v2 model. While this project focuses on the deployment process, it can be extended into a full-featured API in the future.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback on this repository!
